## InstaClone

We’re asking you to create a small MVP-like web application mimicking
basic Instagram functionality including:

- Basic user model with sign-in / sign-up and sessions
- Pictures + descriptions upload and showing in user’s feed
- Commenting posts (single level, no threads necessary)
- Likes and Top-rated feed
- My feed with filters by rating (likes), created_at, comments count

Neat responsive convenient UI is well appreciated as are well-designed
inputs and pages.

It’s up to you to decide, whether to use specific CSS frameworks, gems or
other tools (we just ask you to stay with SQL + Rails + Typescript/React),
will it be SPA or not, webhooks based on endpoints only, etc.
and how many efforts to invest into the task.

We will evaluate the total coding and UX quality of the product.

We are sure that it’s very possible to create a good-working full-feature
application of this scope in one day or less.
